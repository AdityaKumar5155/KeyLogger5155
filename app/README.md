Hey Contributor,

This application is a keylogger application which gathers information about keylogging, Screenshots and clipboard.
But you may make it doing more things or improve the performance of the code.

The file you are gonna work with here is guikeylogger.py.

Make sure that you are in this directory in terminal and run:-
For windows:-
python guikeylogger.py

For linux:-
python3 guikeylogger.py

NOTE:- launching the app from vsCode run code functionality may give error that directory "data" doesn't exist. So, make sure you are following the executing method as shown above.
